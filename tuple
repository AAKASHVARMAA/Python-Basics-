A tuple in Python is a immutable (unchangeable) collection of ordered elements, which can hold a variety of data types. It is similar to a list, but unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified once they are created.

Key Characteristics:
Immutable: Once a tuple is created, its values cannot be changed, added, or removed.
Ordered: Elements in a tuple have a defined order, and the order is preserved.
Can hold multiple data types: Tuples can store integers, strings, floats, and other types of data in a single collection.
Defined with parentheses: Tuples are created using parentheses () instead of square brackets [].
